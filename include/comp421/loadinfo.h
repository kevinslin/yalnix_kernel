/*
 *  Define the external interface to the LoadInfo() function.
 *
 *  LoadInfo() is passed an open file descriptor number and a pointer
 *  to a "struct loadinfo".  The file descriptor should be open
 *  to an ELF format executable file that has been linked to
 *  execute as a Yalnix user process.  On successful return,
 *  LoadInfo will have filled in the struct loadinfo with the
 *  information needed by LoadProgram() to load the Yalnix user
 *  program into memory and set it up for execution.
 *
 *  LoadInfo() returns 0 (= LI_SUCCESS) on success.  Any other
 *  return value indicates an error, as defined by the other LI_*
 *  values below.
