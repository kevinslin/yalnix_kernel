 *  Switching thread context (which is done from inside the kernel) is
 *  tricky.  Real operating systems do this within one function that
 *  is careful not to use local variables or make function calls, so
 *  that the kernel stack can be switched without messing up the switch
 *  itself.  The operating system also has to be careful to save and
 *  restore registers without interfering with the code that saves and
 *  restores them.  For these reasons, this is usually done in
 *  carefully-written assembly code.
 *
 *  To make the job of switching thread context easier in the project,
 *  we provide the function:
 *
 *     int ContextSwitch(SwitchFunc_t *, SavedContext *, void *, void *)
 *
 *  The type SwitchFunc_t ("context switch function" type) is a messy
 *  C typedef of a specific kind of function (matched by MySwitch,
 *  below, for example).
 *
 *  The function ContextSwitch temporarily stops using the standard
 *  kernel stack, saved the current hardware context in the SavedContext
 *  pointed to by the second argument, and calls a function provided
 *  by you (suppose your function is called MySwitch):
 *
 *     SavedContext *MySwitch(SavedContext *, void *, void *)
 *
 *  The pointer passed as the first argument is the same SavedContext
 *  pointer passed to ContextSwitch (as its second argument).  The
 *  two "void *" arguments to ContextSwitch will be passed unmodified
 *  to MySwitch.  You should use them to point to the current thread's
 *  PCB and to the PCB of the new thread to be context switched in,
 *  respectively.
 *
 *  In MySwitch, you should do whatever you need to do to context
 *  switch between these two threads.  The "SavedContext *" argument
 *  passed to MySwitch is a pointer to a temporary copy of the current
 *  thread's context somewhere in memory.  You should copy this
 *  SavedContext (not just the pointer) into the old thread's PCB.
 *  The "SavedContext *" value you return from  MySwitch should
 *  point to a SavedContext containing the context of the new
 *  thread to run.  This SavedContext *must* have been created
 *  by some call to ContextSwitch.  If you return the same
 *  ContextSwitch * pointer that was passed to your MySwitch
 *  function, no switch actually occurs, but you can still save
 *  the SavedContext in a PCB for later use on some other
 *  ContextSwitch call.
 *
 *  You should use ContextSwitch to in effect "block" a thread
 *  somewhere in the middle of some procedure somewhere inside your
 *  kernel.  ContextSwitch and MySwitch do the context switch, and when
 *  this thread is later context switched back to, ContextSwitch
 *  returns.  The return value of ContextSwitch in this case is 0.
 *  If, instead, any error occurs, ContextSwitch does not switch
 *  contexts and returns -1.
